Howdy!

This is a simple snake game but with a slight twist (I recommend the fast mode) because snake is too easy.

You can download all the source files (.py) into a project in VScode and play the game by running the 'main' file!
Simply press 1,2 or 3 to slect a mode (speed dependent) when the game appears then play with your arrow buttons.

Otherwise (easier) you can simply download the "untitled video" file and watch a simple video of the game. The first time running the game in the video I played on medium mode and the second time running I played the faster version.
